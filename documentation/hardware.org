The pinout of the FPGA is defined in the [[https://www.latticesemi.com/view_document?document_id=49390][pinout]]; using the pinout create a [[../projects/leds/pinmap.pcf][pinmap]] file with the pins used in the project.

  
** LEDs

   The breakboard exposes 8 LEDs directly connected to IO,

** FTDI FT2232H

The breakout board communicates to the PC using a USB bridge from FTDI, [[https://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/ICs/DS_FT2232H.pdf][see data sheet]].
The FT2232 is a bridge between USB and UART and SPI interfaces, in particular is exposes 2 SPI interfaces and
2 RS232, but only the first SPI and first RS232 are wired.

The bus AD connects to the Flash and FPGA configuration interface.

| ADBUS0         | SCK    | R11      | iCE_SCK          |
| ADBUS1         | SI     | P11      | FLASH_MOSI       |

| ADBUS7         |        | N11      | iCE_CRESET       |


The RS232 interface is connected to bus BD

| BDBUS0         | B10 (PIO0_14) | RS232_Rx_TTL     |
| BDBUS1         | B12 (PIO0_13) | RS232_Tx_TTL     |
| BDBUS2         | B31 (PIO0_09) | RTSn             |

| BDBUS7         | B15 (PIO0_01) | DCDn             |

RS232 data rate is limited to 12Mbaud. 


    
** Clock

There is a 12MHz clock from a ceramic resonator connected to *pin J3*.

Since the FPGA has a PPL we can scale the incoming clock. Technical note [[http://www.latticesemi.com/~/media/LatticeSemi/Documents/ApplicationNotes/IK/iCE40sysCLOCKPLLDesignandUsageGuide.pdf?document_id=47778][TN1251]] discusses setting the clock.

*** TODO Add code showing how to change the clock
*** TODO Define what are the valid clock ranges

** Jumpers define the programming options
   There are two types of programming configuration
*** SPI Flash mode
  - There is a 32Mb Micron Flash with SPI interface that is used to store the program (N25Q032A13ESC40F - this part is EOL)
  - The FTDI SPI interface programs the flash memory; i.e. FPGA gets reconfigured after power up.
  - Jumper locations:
    + J7:1-2
    + J6:2-4 J6:1-3
*** SPI peripheral mode
  - THE FTDI chip programs the volatile CRAM in the FPGA
  - Jumper locations:
    + J7: open
    + J6:3-4 J6:1-2

** Power
The board gets powered from the USB bus (+5V), the input voltage is fed to a regulator LT3030EFE,
configured to generate the +3.3V and +1.2V rails.

The board has a single ground plane.

NOTE: the USB rail can carry 500mA current, this sets the limit of power that can be consumed
in the board. Verify that the IO banks are configured not to use more power than provided.
