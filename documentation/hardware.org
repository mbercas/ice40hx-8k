The pinout of the FPGA is defined in the [[https://www.latticesemi.com/view_document?document_id=49390][pinout]]; using the pinout create a [[../projects/leds/pinmap.pcf][pinmap]] file with the pins used in the project.

  
** LEDs

   The breakboard exposes 8 LEDs directly connected to IO,

   | LED6 | D3         | B3  |
   | LED7 | D2         | C3  |

Additionally LED D10 is connected to the CDONE signal and can be monitored to determine that the FPGA has been programmed correctly.

** Test points

There are several test points in the baord.

** FTDI FT2232H

The breakboard communicates to the PC using a USB bridge from FTDI, the bridge can be used as RS323 or SPI

*** TODO How is the connection selected?

| FTDI_TX |           | B12 |
| FTDI_RX |           | B10 |
    
** Clock

There is a 12MHz clock from a ceramic resonator connected to *pin J3*.

Since the FPGA has a PPL we can scale the incoming clock. Technical note [[http://www.latticesemi.com/~/media/LatticeSemi/Documents/ApplicationNotes/IK/iCE40sysCLOCKPLLDesignandUsageGuide.pdf?document_id=47778][TN1251]] discusses setting the clock.

*** TODO Add code showing how to change the clock
*** TODO Define what are the valid clock ranges

** Jumpers define the programming options
   There are two types of programming configuration
*** SPI Flash mode
  - The FTDI SPI interface programs the flash memory; i.e. FPGA gets reconfigured after power up.
  - Jumper locations:
    + J7:1-2
    + J6:2-4 J6:1-3
*** SPI peripheral mode
  - THE FTDI chip programs the volatile CRAM in the FPGA
  - Jumper locations:
    + J7: open
    + J6:3-4 J6:1-2
